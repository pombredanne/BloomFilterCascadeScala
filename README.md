# Development environment
The code is implemented in [JetBrain's IDEA 13.1](http://www.jetbrains.com/idea/?gclid=Cj0KEQjwur2eBRDtvMS0gIuS-dYBEiQANBPMR2cbISC8tkLcvpeV4q44S_2ikOpg8gdu-ht1kTjv9SwaAkCj8P8HAQ) with Scala plugin: IDEA with Scala plugin must be installed in order to build the code using IDEA. 

It also has build.sbt, so you also can use sbt. 

    sbt compile <- for build
    sbt test <- for test
    sbt package <- for generating jar
